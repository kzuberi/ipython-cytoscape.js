Cytoscape.js network visualization widget for the IPython Notebook

Notebooks working out the basics of implementation:

-  [no widget]
   (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/kzuberi/ipython-cytoscape.js/blob/master/examples/no\_widget.ipynb):
   direct use of Cytoscape.js within notebook.
-  [prototype widget]
   (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/kzuberi/ipython-cytoscape.js/blob/master/examples/widget\_prototype.ipynb):
   try IPython 2.0 widget support to populate graph data. Probably won't
   work in nbviewer until its widget support is updated.
