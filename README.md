Cytoscape.js network visualization widget for the IPython Notebook

Notebooks working out the basics of implementation:

 * [no widget]
 (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/kzuberi/ipython-cytoscape.js/blob/master/examples/no_widget.ipynb):
 direct use of Cytoscape.js within notebook.
 * [prototype widget]
 (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/kzuberi/ipython-cytoscape.js/blob/master/examples/widget_prototype.ipynb):
 try IPython 2.0 widget support to populate graph data. Probably won't work in nbviewer until its widget support is updated.
